<h1>About MAHARAJ</h1>
<hr/>
<p>Shivaji was the founder of the Maratha Empire in the Indian subcontinent. 
  This article describes Shivaji's life from his birth until the age of 19 years (1630â€“1649).

<br/>
  Shivaji was born at the hill fort shivneri on 19 February 1630 At the time of his birth, both the families of his father Shahaji and his mother Jijabai, 
   served the Ahmednagar Sultanate in military and administrative capacities,
    although they subsequently transferred their allegiance to the Mughal Empire
     and the Bijapur Sultanate at different times.
     <br/>
  
  As a servant of Bijapur, Shahaji was deputed in southern Deccan after 1636, 
  and did not see Shivaji for several years. Shivaji and his mother remained in Pune in Deccan, 
  where Shahaji's subordinate Dadoji Kondadeo administered the family's jagir (feudal land grant) 
  in Shivaji's name. As a teenager, Shivaji started acting independently of the Bijapur government,
   against the advice of Shahaji and Dadoji. He captured several hill forts at the
    expense of other vassals of Bijapur, and by the age of 15.
    <br/>
  
  After Dadoji's death in 1647, Shivaji assumed full control of his father's jagir in the Pune region, 
  and eliminated local challenges to his authority. He then invaded the northern Konkan region, 
  making inroads into the territory of the Siddis of Janjira.
